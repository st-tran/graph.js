            <h1>Examples of my graph.js library</h1>
            <p>Here you'll see two examples of how my library can be used. Both graphs are directed graphs. The one on the left contains randomly positioned nodes every refresh, whereas the one on the left has a fixed position as it is a binary tree.</p>
            <p>You may perform a BFS or a DFS to visualize these algorithms on the graphs. More support to be added later.</p>
            <p>You can also reposition nodes by clicking and dragging them, or reposition the entire graph by clicking and dragging on empty space.</p>
            <p>The library was built with convenience for the developer in mind. One example would be the barebones styles associated with the elements that are generated. The graph and graph controls are injected into the DOM without any styles so that the developer can style the page themselves. I've added styles, which can be viewed in example.css.</p>
